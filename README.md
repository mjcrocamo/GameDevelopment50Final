Final Project for Game Design 50. Blue Beard's Adventure, similar to super mario bros

Play as Blue Beard the Pirate on his adventure to find his treasure. Grab the key in each level to open the chest at the end and advance to the next level. You can have him grab the red starfish and he will launch into a power up mode where he will run and kill anything in his path. He will set off bombs if he gets too close, but if he get's out of the radius of the blast he will not get injured. Everything within the radius of the bomb will take damage. Each contact with a shark, snapper fish, snail, or bomb will have him lose a point of damage. Once he loses 6 points the game is over. I also updated the collision detection so he falls through the open spaces more easily and each time the game loads it's a random song. Each level get's progressively longer and harder. More enemies spawn as the player progresses. Blue beard can also collect coins and hearts for health and points if he comes into contact with a crate. I hope you enjoy playing this game and this class was an awesome experience :).
